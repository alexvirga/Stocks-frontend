## Portfolio explanation

The portfolio list contains two tabs: Stock Price and Equity

#### Stock Price

Stock price displays the current price per share of the stocks in your portfolio. Conditional format is calculated by daily stock performance. 

Ex. If a stock is down from opening price, it will be displayed in a red container.

#### Equity

The equity tab displays the total value of your shares given current market price, as well as the total cost of the stocks purchased. Conditional format is calculated by the difference between Value vs. Cost

Ex. If the value of your shares is greater than the cost, value will be displayed in a green container.
